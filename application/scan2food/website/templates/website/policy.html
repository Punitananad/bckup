            <h1 class="section-heading">Pricing Policy</h1>
            <p>At Scan2Food, we provide software solutions to theatres for seamless food ordering and management. Our
                pricing is designed to be transparent and tailored to your business needs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="sub-section-heading">Annual Subscription Fee:</span> Theatres using the Scan2Food
                    platform are billed on an annual basis. The subscription fee is determined by the number of screens,
                    the volume of orders, and the features required.</li>
                <li><span class="sub-section-heading">Customization Costs:</span> If your theatre requires additional
                    customization or bespoke features, there may be an additional one-time fee, which will be outlined
                    in your service agreement.</li>
                <li><span class="sub-section-heading">Service Fees for Theatre Patrons:</span> While theatres pay an
                    annual fee, they have the flexibility to impose convenience fees on patrons for using the Scan2Food
                    platform. These charges are set by the theatre and reflected on the customer’s bill.</li>
                <li><span class="sub-section-heading">Payment Terms:</span> Annual subscription fees must be paid
                    upfront, and invoices are provided prior to the renewal date. Payment is processed through secure
                    payment channels.</li>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Shipping Policy</h2>
            <p>Scan2Food provides a software platform for theatres to manage food ordering and delivery services within
                the premises. As such, we do not provide physical shipping services, but we facilitate the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="sub-section-heading">Service Availability:</span> Scan2Food is only available within
                    partnered theatres, where our platform allows customers to order food and have it delivered directly
                    to their seats. All deliveries are managed by the theatre's staff.</li>
                <li><span class="sub-section-heading">Order Management:</span> The Scan2Food platform provides real-time
                    updates on the status of orders, ensuring smooth delivery to patrons' seats.</li>
                <li><span class="sub-section-heading">Delivery Timing:</span> The delivery time depends on the volume of
                    orders and the resources of the theatre's food service. Our system ensures that theatre staff can
                    manage orders efficiently during the busiest times, such as movie intervals.</li>

                <li><span class="sub-section-heading">Customer Data:</span> Theatres using Scan2Food may collect
                    customer information such as names, seat numbers, and food preferences when orders are placed. This
                    data is stored securely and only shared with the theatre for order processing purposes.</li>
                <li><span class="sub-section-heading">Use of Information:</span> Theatre data is used solely to manage
                    the software platform and provide support. Scan2Food does not share, sell, or distribute any
                    personal or business data to third parties, except where necessary to process payments or provide

        <!-- Cancellation/Refund Policy Section -->
        <section id="cancellation-refund-policy">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Cancellation/Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>We understand that changes may occur during the subscription period. Here's how we handle cancellations
                and refunds:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="sub-section-heading">Cancellation of Service:</span> Subscriptions can be canceled with
                    written notice at any time. However, if the subscription is canceled before the end of the annual
                    period, no refunds will be issued for the remaining months of the subscription.</li>
                <li><span class="sub-section-heading">Termination by Scan2Food:</span> We reserve the right to terminate
                    services if the theatre violates the terms of use or fails to make payments. In such cases, services
                    will be suspended until the issue is resolved.</li>
                <li><span class="sub-section-heading">Refund Policy:</span> No refunds are provided once the annual
                    subscription fee has been paid and the service is active. For custom development or additional
                    features, refunds may be discussed on a case-by-case basis if services were not rendered as per the
                    agreement.</li>
